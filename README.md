# Balloons

A small **serverside mod for Fabric** that lets you attach custom balloon models to players using commands.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This mod does **not** include any balloon models ‚Äî you have to add your own!

---

# What it does

This mod lets you define **balloons in a config file**.
Balloons can be permanent (persist after death, does not require them to be equipped)
or based on items with the `minecraft:equippable` component or using [trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets-polymer)

You can add the `balloons:balloon` component to any item.

Each balloon is linked to a specific item, a model file, and an optional animation.

There is **no client mod required** ‚Äî models are handled via `.bbmodel` or `.ajblueprint` files, and shown using item displays and a generated resourcepack.

---

# Setup

### ü™Ñ Add balloon models

Put your model files in:

```
config/balloons/<model>.bbmodel
```

- The model filename (without extension) becomes the internal model ID used in the config.
- Supports both `.bbmodel` (Blockbench) and `.ajblueprint` (Animated Java) formats.

---

### Config file

The mod reads balloon definitions from:

```
config/balloons.json
```

**Storage options:**

* `storage-type`: Can be `LPMETA`, `MONGODB`, `MARIADB`, `POSTGRESQL`, or `SQLITE`
* `database`: Defines connection details for databases

** `gui`: **

* Customize button positions with the config
* Adjust menu heights and titles

** `permissions`: **

Allows to assign vanilla permission levels for the luckperm nodes.

** `messages`: **

Player facing messages / strings

# Commands

This mod adds simple commands to allow permanent attachment of the balloon to the player and to remove it.

```
/balloon show <id>
/balloon hide
```

Example:

```
/balloon show test:one
```

This will attach the balloon with ID `test:one` (from your config) to the player.
The balloon will respawn immediately after the player respawns.

To add balloons to the players available selection, use `/balloon give <player> <id or *>`
To remove balloons from the players available selection, use `/balloon remove <player> <id or *>`

`/balloon` will display the selection UI

`/balloon <id>` run by a player will set the balloon with the given id as active

`/balloon reload` to reload the config and db connection

---

# Components

- `balloons:token`: For voucher items that can be redeemed by using the item (the item won't be consumed if the player already has the balloon available to them)

- `balloons:balloon`: For items that should display the balloon if worn as equipment or trinket. Has the same fields the "data" object in the config has, for example "model", "animation", "show_leash", etc.

---

# filament support

[Filament](https://modrinth.com/mod/filament) based items with the `balloons:balloon` will be automatically added as option to the `/balloon show <id>` command, using the items' id.
The mod will also try to load blockbench models from filament datapacks if its installed and has the model loaded.
Make sure to specify a namespace in this case!

# Notes

- This is a backend mod only ‚Äî it doesn't add items, recipes, or models directly.
- You'll need to provide your own models.
- Useful for customized servers, cosmetics, or just for fun.
